    <pre> All About Animals is an Australian television series. It is a show about all types of animals including Australian native animals, exotic animals and pets. The show is hosted by 9-year-old[when?] Olivia Todd and her 15-year-old[when?] brother, Jake. Together they travel to a range of animal sanctuaries, zoos and wildlife parks to learn interesting things about different animals. They also interview a range of celebrities who love animals or are representatives of different wildlife organisations.

        The key messages Olivia and Jake aim to communicate are about responsible pet ownership as well as animal welfare and conservation. The show is filmed in different parts of Australia.</pre>
